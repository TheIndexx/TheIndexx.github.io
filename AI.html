<h1 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>One of my favorite topics to learn about. The whole concept of machines using the human development of knowledge creates a wonderful connection between biology and technology, 2 unalike fields. There are lots of misconceptions regarding this concept, so the proper definition of AI is simply <em>the connection between algorithms and datasets to establish patterns.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hierarchy</strong>:
Artificial Intelligence -&gt; [[Machine Learning]] -&gt; [[Representation Learning]] -&gt; [[Deep Learning]] </p>
<h2 id="quick-recap">Quick Recap</h2>
<p>Basically, early successes of AI were in very rudimentary settings (IBM AI winning chess championships). But that didn&#39;t really mean much, since the rules of those environments were very simply, not like the real world.</p>
<p>Some people tried to hard code the rules of the world into an AI, called the Knowledge Base Approach -&gt; wasn&#39;t effective -&gt; shows that machines need to learn knowledge through patterns from raw data</p>
<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
<p>[[Machine Learning]]! It successfully yielded &quot;subjective&quot; results that were more attuned to reality</p>
